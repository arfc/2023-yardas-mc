%  Anthropogenic \Gls{ghg} emissions drive global warming. Rapid decrease in
%  global \Gls{ghg} emissions can can dampen the impact of global warming.

  No operating \Gls{msr}s exist, so we must rely on computer simulations and historical references
  to study this technology. A key process to consider for \Gls{msr} modeling is on-line fuel
  reprocessing and its effect on reactor dynamics. SaltProc is an open source
  interface code tool that simulates on-line fuel reprocessing when coupled with
  a depletion-capable transport solver. SaltProc was intended to be usable with
  any depletion solver, but was originally built with support for Serpent2. 
  In this paper, I will present how I overhauled the
  SaltProc code to simplify coupling supports for depletion solvers, and added
  support for OpenMC. I will also present validation results of new functionality on a full-core model
  of the \Gls{msbr}. This is significant as this makes SaltProc the first
  completely open-source tool to simulate on-line fuel reprocessing, as well as demonstrates OpenMC's
  ability to perform transport-coupled depletion in \Gls{msr}s.

\section{INTRODUCTION} 
%Nuclear power currently constitutes one fifth of US domestic electricity
%production and half of US zero-carbon electricity production
%\cite{eia_faq_2021} \cite{doene_facts_2021}. Unfortunately, our current nuclear
%fleet faces several threats to its long-term survival, the most relevant being
%the state of the electricity market: record-low natural gas prices and
%increases in subsidies for renewables without similar compensation for
%nuclear make it uncompetitive in the current market and economically unsustainable in the
%long term if current conditions continue\footnote{This is a generalization as
%the economics of electricity markets is incredibly complex and requires more space that I can give to it
%in this abstract to fully appreciate} \cite{szilard_economic_2016}.
%%perhaps mention all plants that have been shut down recently?

%Assuming that we resolve the economic threats to our current nuclear fleet,
%at some point in the future, we will need to shut down and decommission them.
%To maintain nuclear power's position in our decarbonization technology stack, we
%will need to develop and implement new kinds of nuclear reactors that are more
%sustainable, economically competitive, safe, and reliable than their
%predecessors.
%% I want to make this point differently... the conclusion should be that we need new nuclear power tech to ensure we can decarbonize, but I don't feel like the preceding statements smoothly come to that conclusion in the way I have preseneted them here
 
%\subsection{Molten Salt Reactors}%
%\label{sec:molten_salt_reactors}
\Gls{msr}s are a type of advanced reactor that use a mixture of liquid-phase salts
as a coolant and solvent for the fuel. \Gls{msr}s are of particular interest due
to the unique challenges and opportunities they present for new nuclear fuel
cycles, proliferation safeguards, and multiphysics modeling.

Liquid fuel enables the adoption of online reprocessing by
pumping used fuel out of the reactor and pumping fresh or reprocessed fuel back
into the reactor.\footnote{this concept is known as {\it separations and feeds}}
This enables the removal of undesirable fission products produced by the fission
reaction.


%\Gls{msr}s face several technical and logistical challenges before we can
%deploy them for civilian power generation. High temperature liquid-phase salt
%will steadily corrode metals over time, so the reactor vessel of a \Gls{msr}
%must use special corrosion-resistant materials. High temperature salt itself is
%extremely hazardous and reacts explosively with moisture, so workers handling
%fuel salt must use special procedures and PPE. Remote handling of fuel salt may
%be necessary in some or all instances. Even with such challenges, I believe the
%potential benefits of \Gls{msr} technology merit its development.


No currently operating \Gls{msr}s exist, so \gls{mns} codes will play a
critical role in studying their behavior. In preparation for \Gls{msr}s,
both the \Gls{doene} and the \Gls{nrc} identified several technical gaps
in current \Gls{mns} tools that are necessary for efficient and effective
license application reviews. In particular, both the
\Gls{doene}\cite{betzler_modeling_2019} and the
\Gls{nrc}\cite{usnrc_nonlwr_2020-1} have identified fuel composition and its
evolution in a \Gls{msr} to be key modeling features necessary for accident
analysis. 

\subsection{\Gls{msr} Depletion Codes}%
\label{sec:msr_codes}

To model the changing fuel composition in a \Gls{msr}, two
processes must be considered:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Fuel depletion
    \item Removal and feed processes
\end{enumerate}

We can concisely describe the rate of change of the number density of $n$ nuclides with the equation:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:bateman-1}
    \frac{d}{dt}\vec{N}(t) = \mathbf{A}\vec{N}(t)
\end{equation}

where $\vec{N}$ is a vector containing the nuclide density for $n$ nuclides, and
$\mathbf{A}$ is the depletion matrix\footnote{this matrix contains all the
coefficient terms in the Bateman equation}. Incorporating removals and feeds
into equation \ref{eq:bateman-1} involves the addition of a time dependent
removal factor $r_{i}(t)$ and feed factor $f_{i}(t)$ for each nuclide $i$, which
in matrix form we express as:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:bateman-2}
    \frac{d}{dt}\vec{N}(t) = \mathbf{A}\vec{N}(t) + \vec{S}(t)
\end{equation}

where $S$ is an $n$-vector containing the sums of the removal and feed terms
for each nuclide $i$:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:s}
s_{i}(t) = r_{i}(t) + f_{i}(t) \quad \text{for } i\in[1,n]
\end{equation}

Equation \ref{eq:bateman-2} describes continuous reprocessing.
The additional term in Equation \ref{eq:bateman-2} from continuous reprocessing
may be numerically unstable and require costly computational solvers or
preconditioners.

Alternatively, one could discretize depletion over time. That is,
run a depletion simulation, perform the removals and feeds in an
external application on the resulting material composition, and run
another depletion simulation on the reprocessed composition. This procedure
models batch-wise reprocessing, in which material from the core is
reprocessed at regular intervals rather than continuously. Batch-wise
reprocessing enables flexibility in the choice of depletion solver, as an
external software tool can perform the reprocessing step and feed the results
back into the depletion solver.

        \hline
    \end{tabulary}
\end{table}


\SaltProc\cite{rykhlevskii_saltproc_2018}, the subject of this paper, is an open
source tool for simulating depletion with removals and feeds in \Gls{msr}s
using a batch-wise reprocessing approach. \SaltProc currently uses
\SerpentTWO\cite{leppanen_serpent_2014} to run depletion simulations.
While other software with comparable capabilities exist (see Table
\ref{tab:msr_depletion_tools}), \SaltProc is unique among its peers as an open
source interface code. As an interface code, \SaltProc can be used (in theory)
with whatever depletion-capable transport solver the user already has access to.
As an open source project, \SaltProc leverages the expertise of the community
in its development process and lowers the barrier of entry for students and 
researchers to use the code.

%Historically, software used in licensing, \gls{rnd}, and \gls{ent} efforts in
%the nuclear field have been closed source and proprietary. For \Gls{rnd} and
%\Gls{ent} efforts in particular, the liscening process can bring collaborative
%efforts to a grinding halt. Using \gls{cc}s in scientific publications and
%research presents barriers to reproducibility and the ability of external
%verification of results.
    
%Regulatory bodies will require new software features (and, in some cases, entirely
%new software tools) to effectively and efficiently perform licensing
%activities for the next generation of advanced reactor designs
%\cite{usnrc_nonlwr_2020-1}, and many of the open source tools emerging in the
%past decade (e.g., \OpenMC\cite{romano_openmc_2015}) have the advantage over
%their legacy \Gls{cc} ancestors (e.g., \SerpentTWO \cite{leppanen_serpent_2014})
%of using best-practices for software development. Thus, the features
%and tools required may be more readily implementable and usable in open source projects than
%in closed codes.

%We are entering the era of \gls{oss} purpose-built for nuclear
%science and engineering applications. The number of open source projects in this
%field
%(\ONIX\cite{de_troullioud_de_lanversin_onix_2021}, \OpenMC,
%\NJOYTWOONE\cite{noauthor_njoy21_2022}, \Cyclus\cite{noauthor_cyclus_2022}, to
%name a few) is growing in recognition of the need for distributable,
%high-quality, and transparent software tools. The \Gls{iaea} facilitated
%\Gls{oncore} initiative \cite{fiorina_initiative_2021} is the best
%example of the push towards \Gls{oss}, as seen in the mission statement: to
%``[promote] development and application of open-source multi-physics simulation
%tools to support research, education, and training for analysis of advanced
%nuclear power reactors'' \cite{iaea_open-source_2022}. 

I am working on implementing support for \OpenMC's depletion solver in SaltProc,
and will verify my implementation on a model of the \Gls{msbr}. This will 
demonstrate \OpenMC's capability to perform depletion on \Gls{msr}s, as well
as make \SaltProc usable by the community in general for research and
education.

\section{MOLTEN SALT REACTOR MODEL}
\label{sec:msr-model}

The \OpenMC \Gls{msbr} model is a reproduction of the on the \SerpentTWO
\Gls{msbr} model in \cite{rykhlevskii_modeling_2019}, which in turn is based on
the specifications of the MSBR design report \cite{robertson_conceptual_1971}.
The MSBR geometry is highly complex, and as such the model presented here
is a simplified version from the one in the paper. Some differences may be
observed in Figure \ref{fig:msbr}.

\section{CURRENT AND ONGOING WORK}

I have preliminarily verified the \OpenMC MSBR model against the \SerpentTWO
model in both a neutron transport simulation, and a depletion simulation.

I am currently working on finishing implementation of \OpenMC support in
\SaltProc. In the full paper, I will present and compare results for depletion
with and without online reprocessing between \OpenMC coupled and \SerpentTWO
coupled \SaltProc. This will be accompanied by a discussion of the differences
in modeling depletion with each transport code.
